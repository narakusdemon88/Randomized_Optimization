Assignment 2: Randomized Optimization
Created by: Jon-Erik Akashi (jakashi3@gatech.edu)

About Project:
This repository contains code implementations for four randomized optimization algorithms :
1. Randomized Hill Climbing
2. MIMIC
3. Simulated Annealing
4. A Gentic Algorithm

Code Repository:
https://gatech.box.com/s/o76bv6qz9vibip4irgjgyi528hgygcsx

Dataset (located in datasets directory):
titanic.csv
winequality-red.csv

Original location of datasets:
Titanic: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/vinicius150987/titanic3
Red Wine: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/uciml/red-wine-quality-cortez-et-al-2009

Requirements:
The code has been tested and developed using Python 3.8/3.11 and uses the following packages:
matplotlib==3.6.2
numpy==1.24.1
pandas==1.5.2
scikit_learn==1.2.1
mlrose-hiive==2.2.4
(see requirements.txt for all packages I had in this project)

Usage and Outputs:
The four randomized optimization problems are located in the Randomized Optimization directory. The neural network second half of the project is saved as NN.py

Other notes:
Not all image outputs were used in the report.
Some charts were generated using outputs obtained while debugging.
The program was written and tested using Pycharm professional.
Some hyperparameters were manually run/tested and would need to be modified by the user to achieve outputs similiar to those used in the paper.
Not every condition uses a random seed so some results may look slightly different from those in the paper.
